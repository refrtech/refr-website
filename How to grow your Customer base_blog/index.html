                            more leads with Refr:
                        <ol>
                            <li class="ol_li">Perfect your Store Profile</li>
                            <li class="ol_li">Enhance your campaigns</li>
                        </ol>
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p> 1. Perfect your Store profile :</p>
                        <p>
                            Your Store profile is the first page that visitors see after clicking a recommendation. If
                            you’re running a recommendation lead-generating campaign, this page should allow your
                            visitors to take the action that you want like ordering online or visiting your physical
                            store.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>

                            Since you’re asking people to take action, your store page should have all the information
                            the user needs to see.
                        </p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p class="fw-medium">Contact info</p>
                        <p>
                            When a customer clicks on a recommendation for your store, we will redirect him/her to your
                            store page on the Refr marketplace where they should get accurate information like your
                            contact number for queries via call or Whatsapp, your store location in case of an offline
                            store and timings.
                        </p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p class="fw-medium">Credibility</p>
                        <p>
                            Add a paragraph about your store and its core philosophy. Add your social links to enhance
                            your store profile so that users can get added information about your store through your
                            instagram and facebook accounts, this will lend added credibility to your store.
                        </p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p class="fw-medium">Inventory</p>
                        <p>If you are selling online then make sure your inventory is uploaded accurately along with
                            detailed product descriptions and photos. You can also add discounts to select products.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Did you know?</p>
                        <p>Placing your Refr QR at various spots in your store increase your chances of getting
                            recommendations from customers.
                            Refr also provides delivery cards with your store specific QR which you can send with your
                            product packages so customers can recommend your business. </p>

                        <p>2. Set and Enhance your campaign</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Here are a few tips to help you improve your Refr Campaigns, drive more traffic and leads
                            and repeat users:</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Set the right reward structure 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Your recommendation campaign will have the following structure 
                            -	Cost-Per-Recommendation: This amount is deducted from your Campaign wallet whenever someone clicks on the recommendation sent out for your store, make sure you set your budget considering multiple factors like your average daily footfall, average ticket size(how much each user spends per visit) and what kind of reach you want to achieve with your campaign.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            -	Cost-Per-Conversion: This amount is deducted from your Campaign wallet when a customer converts as a sale for your store. The customer will present to you with the recommendation they have received for your store. This value is usually higher than the cost-per-recommendation value as here you are rewarding a new conversion & sale. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Setting a minimum order value for Conversions- you can set a minimum order value that the customer has to fulfil in order to redeem his/her recommendation.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Remember that amount that is deducted from your wallet is being credited to the customer in form of app tokens which he can spend back at your store on his/her next visit. So it is advisable to keep higher campaign values to see higher conversions.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            3. Keep a track of what’s working for you and what isn’t - 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            You can see the performance of your campaigns on your Refr seller app in the performance section where we will provide key metrics such as Month on month recommendation count for your store, how many clicks and views has your store received and how many of those have got converted to actual sales.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Keep track of your insights & optimise your campaigns so you can grow your reach, increase walk-ins & sales on Refr.
