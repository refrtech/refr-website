                            The ‘REFR Wallet’ payment option is a closed loop prepaid payment instrument provided by
                            REFR in order to facilitate the
                            payment for purchase of Products or Services available on its own platform. REFR Cash is the
                            in-app currency, which is
                            stored in the REFR Wallet. All businesses enlisted on the REFR platform accept payments &
                            reward cashbacks to the users
                            on the platform in the form of REFR Cash. REFR Cash cannot be withdrawn from the REFR Wallet
                            into the user’s bank
                            account.
                        </span>
                    <div class="ans mb1">
                        If a User cancels an order for which payment has already been made to REFR, the User shall have
                        an option to credit the
                        monies paid towards the order into his/her REFR Wallet. In addition to paragraph 3.7.3 above,
                        any and all refunds with
                        respect to Product(s) purchased through the ‘cash on delivery’ Payment Option may be transferred
                        into the User’s REFR
                        Wallet. The balance lying in a User’s REFR Wallet can be used by such User for future purchases
                        only on the REFR
                        Platform, and will not be refunded back to the User unless permitted under applicable laws. In
                        the eventuality of a User
                        wishing to deactivate his/her account with REFR, the User agrees that all monies lying in the
                        User’s REFR Wallet, if
                        any, will automatically stand forfeited, and REFR will not be required to process any refunds in
                        any manner whatsoever.
                        The User therefore agrees to use and exhaust any balance in his/her REFR Wallet prior to
                        requesting for a deactivation
                        of his/her account on the Platform. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any refund of
                        store credit to customers
                        will be at the sole discretion of REFR. If REFR suspects any fraudulent activities, REFR
                        reserves its right to hold back
                        transfer of any store credits to customers.

                            3.14. Promotional activities. REFR may, at its sole discretion, credit monies into the
                            Users’ REFR Wallets pursuant to
                            discounts offered by it or specified third parties as a part of various promotional events
                            organised by REFR from time
                            to time, and subject to such terms and conditions as notified by REFR at the time of such
                            promotions. Such promotions
                            may be structured in any manner as may be decided by REFR in its sole discretion. For
                            example, the accounts of the Users
                            may be credited with virtual points/cash based on the terms and conditions of various
                            promotions, and a specified number
                            of such points/coins may translate into discounts offered to the Users (by way of credit of
                            monies into the Users’ REFR
                            Wallets) at certain specified/pre-determined events. However, this virtual points/cash can
                            only be used within the REFR
                            app by the user.
