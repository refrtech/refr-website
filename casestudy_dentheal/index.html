                    <p>The Goal and platforms used
                        Dent Heal’s primary objective is to get the word out for their brand organically. The dental
                        clinic's primary challenge is to increase their patient base and establish themselves as a
                        well-known brand in Mumbai, create a loyal community of patients without having to deal with
                        complicated tools or marketing agencies,
                        their goals include increasing brand reach and equity, footfalls, and returns on ad spends.

                        have not yielded the expected results. Moreover, these campaigns were expensive, and the ROI was
                        not guaranteed. They also found that 360-degree marketing is tedious and has to be outsourced.
                        Marketing activities are tedious and time-consuming, and they want a more user-friendly platform
                        that can run on autopilot. They need to manage multiple platforms to accomplish marketing goals,
                        and there is no guaranteed ROI on marketing spends.
