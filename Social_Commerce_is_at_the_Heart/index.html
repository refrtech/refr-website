                            The social commerce revolution is here. Over the last couple of years, we've (quite
                            obviously) spent
                            more time online
                            than ever. Aimlessly scrolling, trying to find a new trend, checking on our favourite celeb
                            etc. One
                            positive outcome of
                            this though, aside from the influx of quality memes, is the extraordinary rise of social
                            commerce.
                            Social commerce is the latest must-know if you want your brand to succeed in today’s
                            commerce
                            landscape, which is well known now.

                            Shopping is such an integral aspect of our lives, we plan shopping weekends, shopping
                            getaways and
                            holidays around it.
                            We wander through shopping districts, malls, and neighborhood markets to seek our next
                            trendy or
                            unique find. Shopping
                            isn’t just a chore, it’s an adventure, and it has a strong social component.We seek opinions
                            for
                            everything from a good place to eat, a fashion boutique, the right doctor, to a stylist for
                            that
                            new look we are yearning for.

                            77% of consumers found themselves very influenced to shop on social media this year.
                            These days, people prefer online shopping, whether it’s out of convenience, because they
                            prefer a
                            solitary experience
                            from the comfort of their couch, or due to a global pandemic. In response, brands are
                            turning to
                            social commerce to
                            bring the fun of shopping onto digital platforms. Scrolling is the new window shopping.

                        <p>
                            We found that not only is social commerce increasing, but its very definition is also
                            expanding to
                            encompass new
                            channels.

                            Viraj Kakde Founder at Refr says “Shopping is fun and experiential, and a chance to discover
                            and be
                            surprised by new
                            things.” Brands that seize the full potential of social commerce will increase engagement,
                            conversions, and revenue.

                            What is social commerce?
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Social commerce is the buying and selling of products and services through shoppable content
                            on
                            social media.
                            With social commerce, users can shop directly through images and videos showcasing products
                            without
                            ever leaving the
                            source. Let’s say you’re scrolling through Instagram, and you see an ad in which a model or
                            influencer is wearing a new
                            dress and accessories. You can tap on any of the displayed items for sale and be sent
                            directly to
                            the store page where
                            you can complete the purchase.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="ques">Why social commerce works
                        </p>

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Two words: Social proof. Social proof is the concept of using the decisions our peers have
                            already
                            made to make our own
                            decisions. For example, if you’re walking through the lanes of Bandra and you see a busy
                            restaurant,
                            you’re likely to
                            believe they serve great food. It wouldn’t be full otherwise, right? Or maybe you’re
                            mindlessly
                            scrolling through
                            Instagram and you see someone wearing a nice dress. It looks great. You decide you want to
                            get it.
                            You buy it.
                            And there’s the primary benefit of social commerce: It exposes brands to new customers and
                            customers
                            to new brands in a
                            casual, engaging setting. Shoppers can explore products without even intending to shop in
                            the first
                            place. Social
                            commerce reaches consumers on the platforms they already use instead of waiting for
                            consumers to
                            seek them out.
                            This is the kind of online shopping experience consumers crave. Our research shows 76% of
                            consumers
                            enjoy making
                            unexpected discoveries. Plus, they’ve already shown up at the party.

                        <p>
                            Refr helps brands take the concept a step further by syndicating shoppable social media posts
                            with their
                            own customers
                            channels. This offers more opportunities for customers to discover the engaging content that’s
                            shared and created within
                            brands’ social communities, new shoppers can then discover and learn more about these stores and
                            click through to a
                            purchase.
