                            account will be put on hold for a period of 90
                            days to ensure smooth closure of transactions which have been made prior to his closure
                            request and this will be
                            available to the said seller for downloading payment and taxation reports, if required.
                            After 90 days, the seller would
                            be required to reach out to us confirming that he has downloaded the reports and requesting
                            for a deactivation again.
                            Upon receiving this confirmation, the merchant’s account will be deactivated provided there
                            are no outstanding payments

                            with REFR again, he/she will not be able to create a new account but the older account can
