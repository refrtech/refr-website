                        <p>Every business, regardless of industry, has a common goal: sell more products. And increasing
                            conversion
                            rates is a big

                            Social commerce offers something radically different from traditional e-commerce by weaving
                            buying
                            and
                            selling into the
                            fabric of everyday life and through a real sense of community and connection. It's set to
                            revolutionize
                            the way we shop:
                            affording new opportunities for people to participate in the global economy as consumers,
                            creators,
                            influencers and
                            sellers, resulting in a power shift from big to small. This will impact every brand, retailer
                            and
                            platform business
                        </p>

                            Around 3.5 billion people i.e 44% of the world’s population – use social media, with consumers
                    in
                    developing countries
                    more likely to have a smartphone with social media apps than they are a laptop. On average
                    consumers
                    spend two and a
                    half hours a day on social platforms, with more than 300 million new social media users coming
                    online
                    between 2019 and
                    2026. For many people, social platforms are the entry point for everything they do online -
                    news,
                    entertainment, and
                    communication. Now commerce is in the mix too.

                        <br><br>
                        <p>People want to buy products and services based on recommendations and inspiration from people
                            they
                            trust. That could be
                            family, friends and communities, and it can also be authentic influencers they follow on social
                            media.
                            They want to feel
                            inspired, informed and confident in what they buy. Social commerce serves these needs, providing
                            an
                            enhanced shopping
                            experience that sparks discovery, enables personalization and leverages individuals’ expertise
                            and
                            authenticity to build
                            trust.

                            I've definitely been finding a lot of smaller shops and I feel like the more that I shop on

                        <p>So what does this all mean for brands, retailers and platforms? One thing's for sure: social
                            commerce
                            is a model they
                            must embrace. For platforms, it opens up new revenue streams just as growth in digital
                            advertising
                            is expected to slow.
                            For retailers, there are opportunities to develop new types of shopping experiences, connect in
                            new
                            ways and engage
                            influencers/creators. And for brands it means embracing the shift from big to small, empowering
                            small businesses and
                            engaging directly with consumers through social platforms.
